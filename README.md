# Term paper - STA4507 Extreme Value Theory & Applications
In recent years, extreme value theory (EVT) has been a popular topic not only in traditional natural science fields such as hydrology, but also in the finance and insurance industries. In summary, EVT can be considered as a general tool to model extreme or rare events such as a 1 in 100 year flood or a 1 in 1000 year economic stress scenario.  Even though EVT is a great theory to model extreme scenarios, apply the EVT can sometimes be difficult especially in the multivariate setting due to the loss of natural ordering in a multidimensional space. This term paper focuses on how to apply the peaks-over-threshold (POT) method of EVT in both the univariate and multivariate settings. The univariate problem focuses more on details of how to apply the POT method, while the multivariate problem focuses on how to capture the positive tail dependence structure using an extreme-value copula. Both problems use the same simulated dataset which is high-dimensional and heavy-tailed. Applications to insurance risk problems.
